How Versioning Works in NodeJS?

// version 

4.18.2

1st part => 4
2nd part => 18
3rd part => 2


3rd part -> Minor fixes (and these are optional updates)

2nd part -> Recommended Bug Fix (Security Fixer)

1st part -> Major Release - Major/Breaking Update (it can break our existing code (because of new features, legacy code removal etc.))

we can download particular version using 

npm install express@4.17.0 (latest is 4.18.3) 


.................................................................

What is ^?

express = ^4.18.3

means the version can go more than 4

2nd and 3rd can change but 1st can't

express = 4.18.3 = Now npm update express won't work first I have to uninstall it and then install it 



express = ~4.18.3

this means 4.18 will not change only minor changes will change
