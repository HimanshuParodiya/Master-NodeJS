Previously we have seen the stateful Authentication.

The problem with stateful auth is when we restart the server or we lose the state.
1) All users will logout 
2) Memory extensive method (use the memory of our server but we have limited memory on the server) 

now stateless server comes into play.
here we pass the state inside the header/token instead of putting it in the backend


example: 

we will add the car number to the parking ticket instead of mapping it with the register.
now anyone can make their ticket so for that we will put a stamp on it so we can recognize it.

3) JWT
now when we create a token/ID for the user we will put the data in it and we will lock it so that people can only read it but can edit it.
for this we use JWT.
