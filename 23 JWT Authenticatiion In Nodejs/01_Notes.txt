Previously we have seen the stateful Authentication.

The problem with stateful auth is when we restart the server or we lose the state.
1) All users will logout 
2) Memory extensive method (use the memory of our server but we have limited memory on the server) 

now stateless server comes into play.
here we pass the state inside the header/token instead of putting it in the backend


example: 

we will add the car number to the parking ticket instead of mapping it with the register.
now anyone can make their ticket so for that we will put a stamp on it so we can recognize it.

3) JWT
now when we create a token/ID for the user we will put the data in it and we will lock it so that people can only read it but can edit it.
for this we use JWT.

==================================================================

so stateful Authentication is more secure 

Stateful authentication is often considered more secure than stateless authentication due to certain characteristics of session management and token handling.

1) Server-Side Storage: In stateful authentication, session data is stored server-side, typically in memory or a database. This reduces the risk of sensitive information (e.g., user credentials or permissions) being exposed to client-side attacks, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

2) Controlled Session Expiry: Sessions can be configured to have an expiration time, after which the user needs to re-authenticate. This helps mitigate the risk of session hijacking attacks, where an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session.

3) Session Revocation: If a user's credentials are compromised or if suspicious activity is detected, sessions can be revoked by the server. This forces users to re-authenticate, preventing unauthorized access even if the attacker has obtained a valid session ID.

4) Token Rotation: Session IDs can be rotated periodically, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit stolen session information. This is particularly effective against session fixation attacks, where an attacker forces a victim to use a known session ID.

5) Protection Against Replay Attacks: Session tokens are typically generated with enough randomness to prevent predictable or guessable values. This makes it difficult for attackers to replay intercepted tokens to gain unauthorized access.

6) Built-in CSRF Protection: Stateful authentication can include built-in protection against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks through mechanisms like CSRF tokens, which are tied to the user's session.

7) Granular Access Control: Session-based authentication allows for more granular access control policies based on user roles, permissions, and session attributes. This enables fine-grained authorization decisions and reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
