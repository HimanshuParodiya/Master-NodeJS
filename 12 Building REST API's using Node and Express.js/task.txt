GET /users - List all users (Render HTML Document)
GET /api/users - List all users in JSON



Dynamic path parameter
GET /api/users/:id  ( :id is variable | Dynamic)
GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1

POST /api/user - Create a new user

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
