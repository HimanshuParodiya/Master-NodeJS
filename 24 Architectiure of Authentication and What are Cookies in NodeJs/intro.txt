1) Cookies are Domain-specific -> Each site will only handle their cookies. facebook will not use Google cookie and Visa-verse
2) We pass the expiry date


But this is browser-specific we can't use it on mobile application


-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let's see the response method
1) The server will create a token.
2) We will send res.json(token)
3) Now we can store this string in our device by file or anything 

but how will we send this string(res.json(token)) 
because cookies are used to send automatically. 

we will make a header and add it there

header {
    token: ______
}

now in every req, we will check the header instead cookies
